\maketitle

My original intention is to collect here some 
material about derived categories, with applications to
algebraic geometry, which will hopefully turn out to be 
useful for my thesis.
I will mainly follow the first chapters of the book
``\textit{Fourier-Mukai transforms in algebraic geometry}''
by Daniel Huybrects \parencite[]{huybrechts} for the part concerning
the construction of derived categories.
My final goal is to develop enough machinery to
understand the proof of \parencite[Lemma~2.18]{seidel-thomas}.

%This chapter is dedicated to a
%recollection of some important definitions and
%results about general category theory,
%so that we can fix some notation.
%Our main goal is to understand 
%adjunctions and equivalences of categories, 
%with some criteria for equivalence,
%because it will be fundamental when
%studying the derived category associated
%to a noetherian scheme.

%\chapter{Abelian categories}\label{AbelianCategories}
%    In many areas of mathematics, especially in geometry 
%    and topology, the introduction of algebraic tools
%    turned out to be a really powerful weapon: for instance,
%    homology is a very important homotopy invariant for topological
%    spaces; derived functors $\Tor$ and $\Ext$ have many applications
%    in commutative algebra (e.g. \emph{Serre's Theorem} 
%    for regular local rings); sheaf cohomology 
%    appears in the study of algebraic varieties,
%    for example \emph{Riemann-Roch Theorem} and so on...
%    \textbf{Abelian categories} are the most general setting
%    in which one can develop homological algebra.
%    The idea is to generalize the properties of the categories
%    of modules over a ring, in such a way that the notions
%    of \emph{(co)chain complexes} and \emph{exact sequences}
%    make sense.

%\chapter{Enriched categories}
%
%In the section of \hyperref[AdditiveCategories]{Additive categories}
%we dealt with some special kind of categories
%endowed with an additional algebraic structure: 
%indeed, morphisms between two objects in a (pre)additive category
%form an abelian group, which is himself an object in $\Ab$;
%thus, we say that it is \emph{$\Ab$-enriched}.
%
%In the context of algebraic geometry, 
%where one deals with varieties, schemes over a field $k$,
%sheaves, it often turns out that morphisms 
%between objects give rise, in fact, to vector spaces:
%thus, one led to talk about $\cat{Vect}_{k}$-enriched
%categories. In this chapter, we give the
%precise definition of what an \emph{enriched category} is,
%and we formalize the concept of a \emph{tensor} in such a setting.

\chapter{Triangulated categories}

While studying algebraic topology and geometry,
abelian categories arise as a natural
setting to develop homological algebra.
In many cases, we come across long exact sequences 
in homology, e.g. the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for
a topological space, which are a powerful tool
for the study of our object of interest,
starting from some sort of decomposition.
Triangulated categories are a special kind of
abelian categories, endowed with a \emph{shift functor}
which allows us to build long exact sequences of objects.
Thanks to this, we will develop
new techniques to study (co)homology objects.
